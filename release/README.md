# Installing and Running the Program

Note that Python 3.9 is required. The application does not work for other versions.

## Linux/Mac

### Install

To install the application, run `source install.sh`. This creates a Python virutal environment `venv`, installs the wheel into it, and activates the virtual environment.

### Run

To run the GUI, run the installer as specified above and then run `sh run.sh`. If you wish to use the CLI, make sure you have the application installed in your Python binary (if you ran the installer, this is in the `venv` virtual environment) and run `automated_cilia_measurements --help`.

## Windows
